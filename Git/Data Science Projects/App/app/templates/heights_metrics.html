            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>The dataset involves a binary classification task where we aim to predict loan approvals (1) or denials (0). Based on the metrics provided:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> The model performs flawlessly, achieving perfect precision, recall, and F1 scores for both classes, resulting in an overall accuracy of 100%. The model seems to have learned the relationship in the data very well.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision Tree:</strong> This model also performs exceptionally, with a high accuracy of 90%. The precision, recall, and F1 scores for both classes are equally well-balanced at 0.90, indicating that it reliably predicts both loan approvals and denials.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> Similar to Logistic Regression, Random Forest achieves perfect performance across all metrics. The accuracy and other evaluation metrics are all 1.00, making this model highly reliable for this task.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Based on the metrics observed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> The model achieves perfect metrics and is performing optimally. It is highly suitable for this dataset, making it the most accurate and reliable model in this comparison.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision Tree:</strong> Although its performance is not quite as flawless as the Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, it still offers a solid performance with an accuracy of 90%. It balances the trade-off between simplicity and performance effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> This model also achieves perfect metrics, and its ensemble learning approach ensures high reliability. It matches the Logistic Regression model's performance, making it a great option as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Both Logistic Regression and Random Forest are excellent choices for this dataset, achieving perfect performance across all metrics. If you're looking for a model with simple interpretation and perfect accuracy, Logistic Regression is the preferred choice. However, Random Forest can provide added robustness through ensemble learning.</p>
