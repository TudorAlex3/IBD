            <h3>Outlier Details</h3>
            <p>Below are some notable observations based on the scatter plots:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>CRIM:</strong> Outliers are areas with crime rates significantly above the median, indicating areas with potential issues that could influence property values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>ZN:</strong> Outliers are wealthy neighborhoods with a high proportion of residential land zoned for large lots, contributing to higher property values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>RM:</strong> Some properties with an unusually high number of rooms are outliers, suggesting these homes are significantly larger than typical housing in the area.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>AGE:</strong> Outliers include areas with many homes built before 1940, which may indicate older housing stock that may need significant investment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>LSTAT:</strong> Outliers represent areas with a very high percentage of lower-income residents, which tend to negatively affect property values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>MEDV:</strong> Outliers in this category include homes with exceptionally high prices, often found in affluent neighborhoods with desirable amenities.
                </li>
