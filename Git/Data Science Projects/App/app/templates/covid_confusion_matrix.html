            <h2>Confusion Matrix for Logistic Regression</h2>
            <pre>
                Predicted:  
                - **0**: Represents negative COVID-19 cases.
                - **1**: Represents positive COVID-19 cases.

                Ground Truth:  
                - **0**: True negative cases where no COVID-19 infection was present.
                - **1**: True positive cases where COVID-19 infection was confirmed.

            <h2>Confusion Matrix for Decision Tree</h2>
            <pre>
                Predicted:  
                - **0**: Represents negative COVID-19 cases.
                - **1**: Represents positive COVID-19 cases.

                Ground Truth:

                Predicted:  
                - **0**: Represents negative COVID-19 cases.
                - **1**: Represents positive COVID-19 cases.

                Ground Truth:  
                - **0**: True negative cases where no COVID-19 infection was present.

            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>The confusion matrices above showcase the classification performance for Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models. Each matrix compares predicted outcomes with actual outcomes (ground truth) for COVID-19 cases, distinguishing between positive and negative cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> Displays balanced classification with minimal overlap between false positives and false negatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision Tree:</strong> Offers clear classification, though with minor inconsistencies in true negatives and positives.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> Maintains high accuracy with consistent distinction between positive and negative cases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Random Forest consistently outperforms other models in distinguishing between positive and negative COVID-19 cases, ensuring the most reliable classification results.</p>
