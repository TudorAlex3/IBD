            <p>
                This report provides an analysis of the relationship between height and weight using scatter plots. 
                The presence of outliers highlights unusual data points, which may be due to measurement errors, 
                extreme values, or unique cases. Understanding these relationships can help in identifying patterns 
                or inconsistencies in the dataset.

                        <td>
                            Represents the height of individuals in inches. Typically distributed around a mean 
                            with slight variations across genders.

                        <td>
                            A few individuals have extremely short or tall heights, which could represent outliers or 
                            errors in data entry.

                        <td>
                            Refers to the weight of individuals in pounds. Weight generally correlates with height, 
                            though variations are influenced by factors like body composition and lifestyle.

                            Some individuals have unusually low or high weights for their height, suggesting potential 
                            anomalies or specific conditions.

            <h3>Outlier Details</h3>
            <p>Below are some notable observations based on the scatter plots:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Height:</strong> Outliers include individuals below 60 inches or above 78 inches. These 
                    could indicate either exceptional cases (e.g., individuals with dwarfism or gigantism) or data 
                    entry issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Weight:</strong> Some individuals weigh less than 120 pounds or more than 250 pounds, 
                    which might reflect measurement inaccuracies or extreme health conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Height-Weight Relationship:</strong> While there is a general positive correlation between 
                    height and weight, deviations from this trend (e.g., very high weights for shorter heights) could 
                    indicate specific anomalies or unique cases.
                </li>
            </ul>
