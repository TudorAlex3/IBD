            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Product_Category_1:</strong> Outliers include records where product sales exceeded 
                    10,000 units. These might indicate promotions or bulk buying patterns.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Product_Category_3:</strong> Certain products, despite showing high sales, were only in 
                    certain categories during specific periods, contributing to the high outlier values.

                <li>
                    <strong>Purchase Amount:</strong> Some transactions show exceptionally high purchase amounts, 
                    indicating that certain customers made high-value purchases, often in larger quantities.
