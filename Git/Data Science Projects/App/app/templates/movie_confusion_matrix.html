            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>The confusion matrices above show the classification results for each model: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Each matrix provides a detailed view of how the models classified instances into the three classes (0, 1, and other) based on their predicted outcomes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For **Logistic Regression**, the confusion matrix shows 18 true negatives (class 0 correctly predicted as 0), 79 true positives (class 1 correctly predicted as 1), 25 false positives (class 1 incorrectly predicted as 0), and 2 false negatives (class 0 incorrectly predicted as 1). This suggests that Logistic Regression is highly effective at predicting class 1 but struggles to accurately predict class 0.</li>
                <li>For the **Decision Tree**, we observe 25 true negatives, 63 true positives, 18 false positives, and 17 false negatives. The Decision Tree performs well in predicting class 1, but it has more false positives for class 0, indicating some misclassification.</li>
                <li>For **Random Forest**, the confusion matrix reveals 18 true negatives, 78 true positives, 25 false positives, and 2 false negatives. Similar to Logistic Regression, Random Forest is strong at predicting class 1 but struggles with class 0 predictions, though with fewer false negatives than the Logistic Regression model.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These confusion matrices illustrate that while all three models perform relatively well, they all show signs of difficulty in accurately predicting class 0, with Logistic Regression and Random Forest experiencing a higher number of false positives compared to the Decision Tree.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Overall Conclusion:</strong> The three models, while performing reasonably well, show a tendency to struggle with class 0 predictions. Logistic Regression and Random Forest demonstrate a strong ability to predict class 1, but both models exhibit higher false positive rates for class 0. The Decision Tree has a more balanced performance but still shows room for improvement, particularly in reducing false positives for class 0 and false negatives for class 1. To improve performance, strategies like class balancing or model tuning could be explored.</p>
