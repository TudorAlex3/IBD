            <p>
                This report analyzes scatter plots from the Million Songs dataset, providing insights into 
                relationships between key attributes such as `Loudness`, `Energy`, `Tempo`, and `Danceability`. 
                These visualizations help identify trends, clusters, and outliers that can offer deeper 
                understanding of the dataset.

                        <td>
                            Loudness measures the overall sound level, while Energy represents 
                            the intensity and activity level of a song.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            A strong positive correlation is observed, indicating that songs with 
                            higher energy levels tend to have higher loudness.

                        <td>
                            Tempo is the speed of a track, measured in beats per minute (BPM), and 
                            Danceability describes how suitable a song is for dancing based on tempo, rhythm, and beat strength.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            Danceability generally increases with tempo up to a certain point, after which it plateaus. 
                            Outliers include extremely fast or slow tempos with high danceability scores.
                        </td>

            <h3>Scatter Plot Insights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Loudness vs. Energy:</strong> The scatter plot reveals a linear trend, where higher 
                    loudness correlates with higher energy, especially for genres like electronic or pop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tempo vs. Danceability:</strong> Songs with tempos between 100-140 BPM often exhibit 
                    the highest danceability scores, while extremely fast or slow tempos are less danceable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Outliers:</strong> Outliers in both plots may indicate unusual songs or data recording issues, 
                    such as extremely low energy with high loudness or high danceability at atypical tempos.
