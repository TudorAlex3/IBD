            <h2>Post-Outlier Removal Summary</h2>
            <p>
                The removal of outliers has provided a clearer picture of the **Gender** distribution in the **Heights and Weights** dataset. With the outliers removed, the data now exhibits a more consistent pattern, offering valuable insights into typical height and weight relationships across genders.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Key Insights Post-Outlier Removal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gender Distribution:</strong>
                    After removing outliers, the gender distribution appears more balanced. The extreme cases that previously skewed the analysis (such as unusually tall or short individuals for their gender) are now excluded, leading to a more accurate comparison of height and weight across male and female individuals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Height vs Gender:</strong>
                    With outliers removed, the relationship between height and gender is more clearly defined. Men typically have a higher average height than women, but the data now reflects this pattern more consistently, without extreme deviations that may have obscured the general trend.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Weight vs Gender:</strong>
                    Post-outlier removal, the weight distribution across genders is better represented. The dataset now reflects a more normal weight range for each gender, providing clearer insights into the typical weight distribution among men and women.
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Improved Visual Insights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Height vs Weight by Gender:</strong>
                    The scatter plot now illustrates a more predictable relationship between height and weight for each gender, highlighting typical patterns without the influence of extreme outliers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gender-Based Comparison:</strong>
                    The cleaned dataset shows a more defined difference in average height and weight between genders, enhancing our understanding of the physiological differences between males and females.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gender-Specific Trends:</strong>
                    With outliers removed, the trend in weight and height across genders is clearer and more statistically significant, supporting more reliable analysis and modeling.
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                Removing outliers has enhanced the quality of the data and visualizations, allowing for more accurate insights into gender-based differences in height and weight. The cleaner dataset now serves as a stronger foundation for further statistical analysis and modeling.
