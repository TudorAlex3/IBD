            <pre>
                Predicted:  
                - **0**: Represents coupon purchases where no discount is applied.

            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>The confusion matrices above showcase the classification performance for Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models. Each matrix compares predicted outcomes with actual outcomes (ground truth) for coupon purchases with and without discounts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> Shows a balanced classification where predictions are closely aligned with actual outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision Tree:</strong> Provides a clear breakdown of true positives and negatives, with some minor inconsistencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> Maintains high accuracy, with minimal discrepancies between predicted and actual values.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> All models perform well in distinguishing between coupon purchases with and without discounts, with Random Forest offering the highest accuracy and consistency.</p>
