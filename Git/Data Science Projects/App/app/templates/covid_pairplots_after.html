            <h2>Post-Outlier Removal Summary</h2>
            <p>
                After removing outliers from the COVID-19 dataset based on the **ProvinceState** column, the pairplots provide a more refined view of the relationships between ProvinceState and key variablesâ€”Confirmed Cases, Deaths, and Recovered cases. This reduction in outliers helps eliminate extreme values that previously distorted the data.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Key Insights Post-Outlier Removal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>ProvinceState Distribution:</strong>
                    By removing outliers, the ProvinceState distribution in relation to COVID-19 cases becomes more balanced. Previously extreme values that skewed the analysis are now excluded, allowing for a more realistic understanding of case distributions across regions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Confirmed Cases:</strong>
                    The relationship between ProvinceState and confirmed cases shows a clearer trend after outliers are removed. Extreme values that may have exaggerated hotspots are excluded, resulting in a more consistent pattern across different regions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Deaths:</strong>
                    Removing outliers helps in understanding the true mortality rate in each ProvinceState, minimizing regions with abnormally high death counts that may have been due to data inconsistencies or reporting errors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Recovered Cases:</strong>
                    Outlier removal enhances the visualization of recovery rates, providing a more accurate representation of regions with higher or lower recovery success rates.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Improved Visual Insights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>ProvinceState-Confirmed Cases:</strong>
                    The scatter plot for confirmed cases now better illustrates the distribution of cases, offering a more reliable overview of regions with consistent data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>ProvinceState-Deaths:</strong>
                    After outlier removal, the scatter plot for deaths provides a more precise understanding of mortality trends across different ProvinceStates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>ProvinceState-Recovered:</strong>
                    A clearer visualization of recovery trends is evident, with the removal of outliers providing a more balanced view of recovery outcomes.
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                Removing outliers has significantly improved the quality of the pairplots, allowing for a more accurate and insightful analysis of the COVID-19 dataset based on ProvinceState.
