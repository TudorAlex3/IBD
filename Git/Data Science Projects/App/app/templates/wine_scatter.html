            <p>
                This report provides a detailed analysis of the wine quality dataset, using scatter plots to examine 
                various factors and their relationships with wine quality. Outliers have been highlighted to provide insight 
                into unusual trends or data points.

            <h3>Outlier Details</h3>
            <p>Below are some notable observations based on the scatter plots:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alcohol:</strong> Wines with very low alcohol content (below 7%) and high alcohol content (above 15%) appear as outliers, 
                    which could be attributed to either mistakes in data entry or wines with distinct characteristics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chlorides:</strong> Some wines show extremely high chloride levels, suggesting a potential error in measurement or a specific 
                    winemaking process that causes unusual chloride levels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Citric Acid:</strong> Wines with very high citric acid levels appear as outliers, which may indicate unique fermentation conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Density:</strong> Some wines have abnormally high densities, possibly linked to higher residual sugars or high alcohol content.
